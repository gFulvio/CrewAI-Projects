Qualitative Spatial Relations (QSRs) describe how the user is interacting with the objects. 
Each object has four QSRs: QDC, QTC, MOS, HOLD.
Every object's QSRs are related to the user:
    - QDC corresponds to the distance between the user and the object(far, medium, near, touch);
    - QTC indicates whether the user is moving in the direction of the object or moving away from it;
    - MOS indicates whether the user is moving or stationary;
    - HOLD indicates whether the object is hold by the user.
Combination of QSRs describe the user's current movement (Still, Walk, Pick, Transport, Place);
Sequences of movements describe the user's current action.
Possible action are:
    - Relocate: sequence of movements Still and Walk;
    - PickAndPlace: Pick, Transport and Place sequence of movements;
    - Use: sequence of Pick and Place movements.
